* RSP
Simple RDM generator

** General Notes
 - Need to decide if radar parameters are added in dB and when to convert
   - Volts -> dB: 10+ log10( abs (Volts) **2 )
 - Why does noise have SNR > 1 in final noise RDM?
 - Pedantic direct match filter is cleaner in phase (zeros where there is no signal)
   - a more efficient one is also implemented but not used (see padantic parameter)
 - Make pulsewidth/2 range offset clearer
 - range bins are A/D samples
 - Break into smaller functions:
   - signal gen?
 - Could make wvf class with BW, pulse_length, time_BW_product attributes
 - make non-skin returns range and range/rate agnostic
   - should be abstract and each method gives parameters

**  Future
- need to fill in all function doc strings with input explanations
 - make VBM it's own function to pull out the details and methods from rdm_gen
 - add range_delta to returnInfo['memory']
 - make a pod (seperate from skin) at the same range as target
 - may move pw/2 offset out of kernel and rtm placement
 - add flag to odify freq due to doppler using frequence_doppler function.
 - make VBM guassian normalization work and make sense (all mags !=1) (method 1.5)
 - setup tests and a CDCI


** Radar PDF
*** Comparison to MATLAB solutions
 - solution SNR does not depend on time-BW product-- assumes it is 1 for all wvfms
 - solution does not account for pulseWidth/2 range offest

*** Section 1 : Range Equation
Exercise figures are displayed with
#+begin_src shell
./range_quation.py
#+end_src
**** Errors
- problem 1 solution: uses 1 foot diameter (not 1.5) for antenna.
- problem 1 question: does not make clear that the antenna parameter is radius, diameter, or circumference.

**** Things to cleanup
- [ ] [[file:./range_equation.py]] : make duty factor a latex /tau in legend of figure 2

*** Section 2 : Doppler Radar Overview
Exercise figures are displayed with
#+begin_src shell
./pulse_doppler_radar.py
#+end_src
**** Errors

**** Things to cleanup

*** Section 3 : Waveforms
Due to the length of the code and the number of figures, the exercises were placed into the [[file:exercises]] directory.
=cd exercises=
#+begin_src shell
cd exercises; ./s3p1.py
#+end_src
